class ProcessEventStream(AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]):
    """A capability that forwards the agent's event stream to a user-provided async handler.

    The handler receives the stream of [`AgentStreamEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.AgentStreamEvent]s
    emitted during model streaming and tool execution for each `ModelRequestNode` and
    `CallToolsNode`. Two forms are supported:

    - An [`EventStreamHandler`][pydantic_ai.agent.EventStreamHandler] — an `async def`
      returning `None`. Events are forwarded to the handler while also being passed
      through unchanged to the rest of the capability chain, so multiple handlers (and
      the top-level `event_stream_handler` argument) can all see the same stream without
      changing each other's view. A handler that returns early stops receiving events
      but does not affect downstream consumers; a handler that raises propagates the
      exception to the rest of the run. Events are delivered synchronously, so a slow
      handler back-pressures the rest of the stream.
    - An `EventStreamProcessor` — an async
      generator yielding [`AgentStreamEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.AgentStreamEvent]s.
      The events it yields replace the inner stream for downstream wrappers and consumers,
      so it can modify, drop, or add events.

    When this capability is registered, `agent.run()` automatically
    enables streaming so the handler fires without requiring an explicit `event_stream_handler`
    argument.

    !!! note "Durable execution"

        Under the current durable-execution integrations
        ([Temporal][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.temporal.TemporalAgent],
        [DBOS][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.dbos.DBOSAgent],
        [Prefect][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectAgent]), model streaming happens
        inside an activity/step rather than in the outer agent loop. This capability's
        `wrap_run_event_stream` hook fires for tool-call events and the final post-streaming
        batch, but it does **not** see individual model-response events live — the underlying
        durable model consumes those inside the activity before returning. The in-flight
        `event_stream_handler` parameter does still observe the live events; a future
        refactor threading the capability chain through the activity boundary is being
        explored in [#4977](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/4977).
