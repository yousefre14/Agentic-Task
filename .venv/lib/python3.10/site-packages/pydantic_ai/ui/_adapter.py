        """Handle a protocol-specific HTTP request by running the agent and returning a streaming response of protocol-specific events.

        Extra keyword arguments are forwarded to [`from_request`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.from_request],
        allowing subclasses to accept additional adapter-specific parameters.

        Args:
            request: The incoming Starlette/FastAPI request.
            agent: The agent to run.
            output_type: Custom output type to use for this run, `output_type` may only be used if the agent has no
                output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's output type.
            message_history: History of the conversation so far.
            deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.
            conversation_id: ID of the conversation this run belongs to. Pass `'new'` to start a fresh conversation, ignoring any `conversation_id` already on `message_history`. If omitted, falls back to the most recent `conversation_id` on `message_history` or a freshly generated UUID7.
            model: Optional model to use for this run, required if `model` was not set when creating the agent.
            instructions: Optional additional instructions to use for this run.
            deps: Optional dependencies to use for this run.
            model_settings: Optional settings to use for this model's request.
            usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
            usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
            metadata: Optional metadata to attach to this run. Accepts a dictionary or a callable taking
                [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext]; merged with the agent's configured metadata.
            infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.
            toolsets: Optional additional toolsets for this run.
            capabilities: Optional additional [capabilities](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/) for this run, merged with the agent's configured capabilities.
                Use `capabilities=[NativeTool(...)]` to add provider-side native tools per request.
            on_complete: Optional callback function called when the agent run completes successfully.
                The callback receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult] and can optionally yield additional protocol-specific events.
            manage_system_prompt: Who owns the system prompt. See
                [`UIAdapter.manage_system_prompt`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.manage_system_prompt].
            allowed_file_url_schemes: URL schemes allowed for file URL parts from the client. See
                [`UIAdapter.allowed_file_url_schemes`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.allowed_file_url_schemes].
            allowed_file_url_force_download: Additional `FileUrl.force_download` values allowed on file URL parts from
                the client (beyond `False`, which is always allowed). See
                [`UIAdapter.allowed_file_url_force_download`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.allowed_file_url_force_download].
            preserve_file_data: Whether to keep `UploadedFile` items from client-submitted messages. See
                [`UIAdapter.preserve_file_data`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.preserve_file_data].
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments forwarded to [`from_request`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.from_request].

            A streaming Starlette response with protocol-specific events encoded per the request's `Accept` header value.
