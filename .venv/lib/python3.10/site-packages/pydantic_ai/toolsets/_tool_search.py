"""Tool search toolset and strategy types.

`ToolSearchToolset` wraps another toolset to support discovery of tools marked with
`defer_loading=True`. Rather than commit to native-vs-local at toolset time (which can't
know which model will actually serve the request — think `FallbackModel`), the toolset
emits one entry per deferred tool with both `with_native='tool_search'` and the
current local visibility on `defer_loading`, then lets
[`Model.prepare_request`][pydantic_ai.models.Model.prepare_request] filter based on the
specific model's support for the framework-managed tool-search builtin:

* On the native path the adapter keeps every corpus member (regardless of local
  discovery state) and applies its provider-specific wire format — e.g. setting
  `defer_loading=True` on the Anthropic / OpenAI Responses tool param so the provider
  drives discovery server-side.
* On the local path corpus members with `defer_loading=True` (still undiscovered) are
  dropped from the wire; discovered ones (`defer_loading=False`) stay so the model can
  call them by their real name.

`search_tools`, the local discovery function, carries `unless_native='tool_search'`
and is dropped by the adapter when the builtin is supported. When the capability commits
to a named-native strategy with no local equivalent (`'bm25'`/`'regex'`) the toolset is
constructed with `enable_fallback=False` and `search_tools` is not emitted at all — that
way `_resolve_native_tool_swap` raises on providers that can't honor the builtin, and
the wire stays clean (just the native tool) on those that can.
