    """Per-case lifecycle hooks for evaluation.

    A new instance is created for each case during evaluation. Subclass and override
    any methods you need — all methods are no-ops by default.

    The evaluation flow for each case is:

    1. `setup()` — called before task execution
    2. Task runs
    3. `prepare_context()` — called after task, before evaluators; can enrich metrics/attributes
    4. Evaluators run
    5. `teardown()` — called after evaluators complete; receives the full result (or `None` when interrupted)

    Exceptions raised by `setup()` or `prepare_context()` are caught and recorded as
    a `ReportCaseFailure`; `teardown()` is still called afterward so you can clean up.
    Exceptions raised by `teardown()` propagate to the caller and may abort the evaluation.
    If your teardown may raise and you don't want it to crash the evaluation run,
    handle exceptions within your `teardown()` implementation itself.

    Args:
        case: The case being evaluated. Available as `self.case` in all hooks.

    Example:
        ```python {lint="skip"}
        from pydantic_evals import Case, Dataset
        from pydantic_evals.evaluators.context import EvaluatorContext
